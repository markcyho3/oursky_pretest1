/* Computational complexity of my answer in question is O(n^2)
There are 3 rules in big O notation:
rule 1: worst case
rule 2: ignore constants
rule 3: certains term "dominate" others : O(1) < O(n) < O(nlogn) < O(n^2) < O(2^n) < O(n!)

My answer worst case process is about m * n * 2 + 1 , which m = size of second_array, n = size of first_array.
Therefore the complexity is about O(n^2).
